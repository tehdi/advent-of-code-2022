approximates the shape of the lava droplet with 1x1x1 cubes on a 3D grid
each given as its x,y,z position
count the number of sides of each cube that are not immediately connected to another cube
if your scan were only two adjacent cubes like 1,1,1 and 2,1,1
    each cube would have a single side covered
    and five sides exposed
    for a total surface area of 10 sides

Part 1
What is the surface area of your scanned lava droplet?

Test: 64

Real
2830 1x1x1 cubes
set of 3ples => set((5, 9, 13), (6, 8, 3), ...)
for each cube in the set,
    exposed sides = 6 - number of adjacent cubes
where adjacent means any of:
    (x+1, y, z)
    (x-1, y, z)
    (x, y+1, z)
    (x, y-1, z)
    (x, y, z+1)
    (x, y, z-1)


Part 2
your calculation also included the surface area of air pockets trapped in the lava droplet
Instead, consider only cube sides that could be reached by the water and steam as the lava droplet tumbles into the pond
The steam will expand to reach as much as possible, completely displacing any air on the outside of the lava droplet but never expanding diagonally.

In the example above, exactly one cube of air is trapped within the lava droplet (at 2,2,5), so the exterior surface area of the lava droplet is 58.

    shift coordinates if necessary to build a box around your lava where (0, 0, 0) is empty
    fill in your lava cubes
    then start at (0, 0, 0) and BFS a collection of adjacent non-lava cubes
    for each cube that is adjacent to lava, mark it as a boundary
    for each cube that is empty, mark it empty so you don't re-search it
    after searching, go back and count all the lava adjacent to the cubes you marked as boundaries (or just count them as you go. that seems easier)
