The clock circuit ticks at a constant rate; each tick is called a cycle.
The CPU has a single register, X, which starts with the value 1
It supports only two instructions:
    - addx V takes two cycles to complete. After two cycles, the X register is increased by the value V. (V can be negative.)
    - noop takes one cycle to complete. It has no other effect.
signal strength is the cycle number multiplied by the value of the X register

register modifications happen at the END of a cycle.
you can't queue up a new instruction while you're still processing an old one
    $ addx 3
    $ addx 5
    cycle 1: addx 3 starts processing
    cycle 2: addx 3 finishes processing. value becomes 4
    cycle 3: addx 5 starts processing
    cycle 4: addx 5 finishes processing. value becomes 9

Part 1
Find the signal strength during the 20th, 60th, 100th, 140th, 180th, and 220th cycles.
What is the sum of these six signal strengths?

Part 2
X register controls the horizontal position of a sprite
    THERE IS ONLY ONE SPRITE
    IF THE REGISTER CHANGES, THE SPRITE MOVES
the sprite is 3 pixels wide
the X register sets the horizontal position of the middle of that sprite
there is no "vertical position": if the sprite's horizontal position puts its pixels where the CRT is currently drawing, then those pixels will be drawn
draws each row of pixels left-to-right
40 wide and 6 high
    - left-most pixel in each row is in position 0
    - right-most pixel in each row is in position 39
draws a single pixel DURING each cycle
