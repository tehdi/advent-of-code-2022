Each monkey yells a number
Some of them are already known,
others are waiting to hear two other monkeys' numbers so they can do math then yell the result

They don't get yelled in the order given in the input
They all yell whenever they know their answer

Eg.
    dvpt: 3
    root: humn - dvpt
    humn: 5
root will yell (5-3=)2

- both test_input and input have only unique monkey names
    i.e. in an input file, if there's a monkey name "humn", then there is only one monkey named "humn"

Part 1
What number will the monkey named root yell?
