approximates the shape of the lava droplet with 1x1x1 cubes on a 3D grid
each given as its x,y,z position
count the number of sides of each cube that are not immediately connected to another cube
if your scan were only two adjacent cubes like 1,1,1 and 2,1,1
    each cube would have a single side covered
    and five sides exposed
    for a total surface area of 10 sides

Part 1
What is the surface area of your scanned lava droplet?

Test: 64

Real
2830 1x1x1 cubes
set of 3ples => set((5, 9, 13), (6, 8, 3), ...)
for each cube in the set,
    exposed sides = 6 - number of adjacent cubes
where adjacent means any of:
    (x+1, y, z)
    (x-1, y, z)
    (x, y+1, z)
    (x, y-1, z)
    (x, y, z+1)
    (x, y, z-1)
