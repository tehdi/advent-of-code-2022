the packets from the distress signal got decoded out of order
how many pairs of packets are in the right order?
Packet data consists of lists and integers.
Each list
    - starts with [
    - ends with ]
    - contains zero or more comma-separated values (either integers or other lists)
Each packet is always a list and appears on its own line.

Comparing packets (left vs right):
    go value by value
    as soon as there's an integer difference, return left < right
    if both are lists, compare the lists value by value. lower integer should always come first
    if list comparison and integers keep being okay, but the right list runs out of values first, then it's out of order
    if one is an integer and one is a list, convert the integer to a single-item list and compare the lists as above

Part 1
Determine which pairs of packets are already in the right order.
The first pair has index 1, the second pair has index 2, and so on.
What is the sum of the indices of those pairs?
