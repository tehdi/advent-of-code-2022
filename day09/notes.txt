consider a rope with a knot at each end
these knots mark the head and the tail of the rope
If the head moves far enough away from the tail, the tail is pulled toward the head.
model the positions of the knots on a two-dimensional grid. Then, by following a hypothetical series of motions (your puzzle input) for the head, you can determine how the tail will move
the head (H) and tail (T) must always be touching (diagonally adjacent and even overlapping both count as touching)
If the head is ever two steps directly up, down, left, or right from the tail, the tail must also move one step in that direction
Otherwise, if the head and tail aren't touching and aren't in the same row or column, the tail always moves one step diagonally to keep up
work out where the tail goes as the head follows a series of motions. Assume the head and the tail both start at the same position, overlapping.

Part 1
How many unique positions does the tail of the rope visit?

Part 2
Now the rope has 10 knots instead of 2, and each follows the one ahead of it according to the same rules.
How many unique positios does the new tail of the rope visit?
