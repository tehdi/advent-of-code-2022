detect a start-of-packet marker in the datastream
indicated by a sequence of four characters that are all different
identify the first position where the four most recently received characters were all different

Specifically, it needs to report the number of characters from the beginning of the buffer to the end of the first such four-character marker.

Part 1
How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-packet marker is detected?

Part 2
A start-of-message marker is just like a start-of-packet marker, except it consists of 14 distinct characters rather than 4.
How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-message marker is detected?
