each rucksack has two large compartments
All items of a given type are meant to go into exactly one of the two compartments
a list of all of the items currently in each rucksack (your puzzle input)
a and A refer to different types of items
each rucksack is given as characters all on a single line
the first half of the characters represent items in the first compartment, while the second half of the characters represent items in the second compartment

To help prioritize item rearrangement, every item type can be converted to a priority:
    Lowercase item types a through z have priorities 1 through 26.
    Uppercase item types A through Z have priorities 27 through 52.

Part 1
Find the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack. What is the sum of the priorities of those item types?

Part 2
Every set of three lines in your list corresponds to a single group, but each group can have a different badge item type
the badge is the only item type carried by all three Elves
Find the item type that corresponds to the badges of each three-Elf group. What is the sum of the priorities of those item types?
