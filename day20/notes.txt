The input is a list of numbers.
To mix the file, move each number forward or backward in the file a number of positions equal to the value of the number being moved.
The list is circular, so moving a number off one end of the list wraps back around to the other end as if the ends were connected.

the grove coordinates can be found by looking at the 1000th, 2000th, and 3000th numbers after the value 0, wrapping around the list as necessary

Part 1
Mix your encrypted file exactly once.
What is the sum of the three numbers that form the grove coordinates?
