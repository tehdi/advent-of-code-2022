Part 2
the example input and the real input are different shapes

this is the real input:
  1 2
  3
4 5
6
also you built a paper cube because wow these transformations

29302 is too low
after fixing my out-of-bounds wrapping, I think, 54206 is also too low
after breaking things and apparently not fixing enough, 174190 is too high

test2: 10006
from https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zst7z3/2022_day_22_part_2_improved_example_input_working/
I'm getting (9, 0) facing right = 10004
but the actual answer should have me facing left, which would be +2 = 10006
so I think my travel logic is correct but something's weird with my final facing
Oh! The final steps try to cross a boundary but hit a wall before jumping that edge
I've adjusted the final facing to reflect the transition, but that transition doesn't actually happen

after fixing that final facing problem, I got 104385
that is way too much differential for just a facing change. what did I even do
at any rate, THAT'S THE RIGHT ANSWER! :D

I bet there was more than one spot where I tried to cross an edge and didn't make it because of a wall
thanks bonus reddit test case!
