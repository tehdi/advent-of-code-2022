oh hey, it's pathfinding day

input = heightmap
elevation of each square = single lowercase letter, where a is the lowest and z is the highest
current position = S (elevation a)
target = E (elevation z)
for each step, I can move 1 up, down, left, or right
each step can be at most 1 elevation rank higher


Part 1
What is the fewest steps required to move from your current position to the location that should get the best signal?
fewest steps for test input: 31

Part 2
What is the fewest steps required to move starting from any square with elevation a to the location that should get the best signal (E)?
fewest steps for test input: 29

alternatively, start at E and find the closest a
while allowing any level of climb, but only 1 level of drop
because backwards
