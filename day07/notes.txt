lines that begin with $ are commands you executed
    cd and ls

cd commands have no output
cd x, cd .., and cd / all do what I expect them to do
there are no more cd commands

ls prints out all of the files and directories immediately contained by the current directory
it's always just `ls`
a file prints as "123 abc", meaning file named "abc" has size 123
a directory prints as "dir xyz"

directories don't have intrinsic size. instead their size is the sum of all files they contain
INCLUDING SUBDIRECTORIES (so nested files get counted once for their immediate parent, then again for their grandparents)

Part 1
Find all of the directories with a total size of at most 100_000. What is the sum of the total sizes of those directories?

Part 2
The total disk space available to the filesystem is 70_000_000. To run the update, you need unused space of at least 30_000_000.
What is the total size of the smallest directory that, if deleted, would free up enough space on the filesystem to run the update?
