you have 30 minutes before the volcano erupts
a network of pipes and pressure-release valves
each valve's flow rate if it were opened (in pressure per minute)
the tunnels you could use to move between the valves

one minute to open a single valve
one minute to follow any tunnel from one valve to another

Part 1
Work out the steps to release the most pressure in 30 minutes. What is the most pressure you can release?
Test: 1651
Valve open order: DD BB JJ HH EE CC

My "random attempts" solution worked:
New best flow after 0 more runs! 669
New best flow after 4 more runs! 671
New best flow after 1 more runs! 801
New best flow after 7 more runs! 829
New best flow after 2 more runs! 1153
New best flow after 50 more runs! 1518
New best flow after 197 more runs! 1583
New best flow after 3544 more runs! 1606
New best flow after 7343 more runs! 1635
New best flow after 14766 more runs! 1646
New best flow after 4202 more runs! 1670
New best flow after 37816 more runs! 1818
New best flow after 2441 more runs! 1845
New best flow after 180610 more runs! 1888
New best flow after 18791 more runs! 1906 <-- is the right answer!

Part 2
With you and an elephant working together for 26 minutes, what is the most pressure you could release?
Test: 1707
    I've gotten this in [1, 3108] attempts. Ah, randomness

Attempts:
    2432 is too low
    2483 is still too low
    2496 is still too low
    2500 is also wrong, and now that I've guessed wrong 4 times I have an extended 5 minute wait timer until I can try again
        that doesn't really matter since it took an hour to get to 2500
