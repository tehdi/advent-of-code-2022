Each monkey yells a number
Some of them are already known,
others are waiting to hear two other monkeys' numbers so they can do math then yell the result

They don't get yelled in the order given in the input
They all yell whenever they know their answer

Eg.
    dvpt: 3
    root: humn - dvpt
    humn: 5
root will yell (5-3=)2

- both test_input and input have only unique monkey names
    i.e. in an input file, if there's a monkey name "humn", then there is only one monkey named "humn"

Part 1
What number will the monkey named root yell?

Part 2
The correct operation for monkey root should be =, which means that it still listens for two numbers (from the same two monkeys as before), but now checks that the two numbers match
"humn" isn't a monkey, it's me
you need to figure out what number you need to yell so that root's equality check passes. (The number that appears after humn: in your input is now irrelevant.)
What number do you yell to pass root's equality test?

step the math backwards
find which side my call goes on. eval the other to get the target
then run down the tree of operations and solve for the missing piece
do this all the way down until you have a value for humn
in test_input, that means:
    humn is on the left
    right evals to 150
    left:
        pppw = cczh / 4 => 150 = cczh / 4 => cczh = 600
        cczh = 4 + lgvd => 600 = 4 + lgvd => lgvd = 596
        lgvd = 2 x ptdq => 596 = 2 x ptdq => ptdq = 298
        ptdq = humn - 3 => 298 = humn - 3 => humn = 301
I should yell 301
