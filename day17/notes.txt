The five types of rocks have the following peculiar shapes, where # is rock and . is empty space:

The rocks fall in the order shown above: first the - shape, then the + shape, and so on. Once the end of the list is reached, the same order repeats

The tall, vertical chamber is exactly seven units wide
Each rock appears so that its left edge is two units away from the left wall and its bottom edge is three units above the highest rock in the room (or the floor, if there isn't one).
After a rock appears, it alternates between being pushed by a jet of hot gas one unit (in the direction indicated by the next symbol in the jet pattern) and then falling one unit down. If any movement would cause any part of the rock to move into the walls, floor, or a stopped rock, the movement instead does not occur. If a downward movement would have caused a falling rock to move into the floor or an already-fallen rock, the falling rock stops where it is (having landed on something) and a new rock immediately begins falling.

Part 1
How many units tall will the tower of rocks be after 2022 rocks have stopped falling?
Test: 3068

Part 2
1_000_000_000_000 rocks!
Test: 1_514_285_714_288

Real input goes in cycles of 1720 rocks
floor(1_000_000_000_000 / 1720) = 581_395_348 complete cycles
1_000_000_000_000 % 1720 = 1_440 non-cycle rocks
so start at rock 1_440, which is height 2_286
+ 1720 rocks = 3_160
height at 3_160 = 4_988
= height diff of 2_702 per cycle

Found a repeated state at rock 3160: Cave profile: (0, 21, 29, 29, 25, 27, 16), Shape: 5, Direction: 8455
Rock count: 1440 -> 3160 = 1720
Height: 2286 -> 4988 = 2702

base height of 2_286
+ 581_395_348 cycles of height 2_702 each
= 2_286 + (581_395_348 * 2_702)
= final height of 1_570_930_232_582
