Phase 1
each Elf considers the eight positions adjacent to themself (NW, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W).
If there are no adjacent Elves: do nothing
Else:
    A: no Elf N, NE, NW: proposes moving 1 step N
    B: no Elf S, SE, SW: proposes moving 1 step S
    C: no Elf W, NW, SW: proposes moving 1 step W
    D: no Elf E, NE, SE: proposes moving 1 step E

Phase 2
try to move in the chosen direction (if any)
if more than one Elf tries to move there, none of them move

Phase 3
rotate direction options A-D
so in round 1 they look N first
but in round 2 they look S first

Part 1
Find the smallest rectangle that contains the Elves after 10 rounds.
Don't worry about diagonals; the edges of the rectangle should be aligned to the N/S/E/W directions
How many empty ground tiles does that rectangle contain?

test_input outcome:
    after 3 rounds, nobody has to move anymore and they end up here:
        ..#..
        ....#
        #....
        ....#
        .....
        ..#..
    which is 6 lines * 5 columns = 30 ground tiles

Part 2
What is the number of the first round where no Elf moves?

test2_input: 20
