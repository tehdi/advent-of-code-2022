tall trees all planted carefully in a grid
Each tree is represented as a single digit whose value is its height, where 0 is the shortest and 9 is the tallest.
A tree is visible if all of the other trees between it and an edge of the grid are shorter than it. Same height is not shorter!
All of the trees around the edge of the grid are visible
Only consider trees in the same row or column; that is, only look up, down, left, or right from any given tree.

Part 1
how many trees are visible from outside the grid?

Part 2
look up, down, left, and right from each tree
stop if you reach an edge or at the first tree that is the same height or taller than the tree under consideration
If a tree is right on the edge, at least one of its viewing distances will be zero.
A tree's scenic score is found by multiplying together its viewing distance in each of the four directions
