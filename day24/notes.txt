The walls of the valley are drawn as #
everything else is ground
Clear ground - where there is currently no blizzard - is drawn as .
Otherwise, blizzards are drawn with an arrow indicating their direction of motion:
    up (^)
    down (v)
    left (<)
    right (>)

when a blizzard reaches the wall of the valley, a new blizzard forms on the opposite side of the valley moving in the same direction
multiple blizzards can occupy the same space
Your expedition begins in the only non-wall position in the top row
your goal is the only non-wall position in the bottom row
each minute, you can move up, down, left, or right, or you can wait in place
You and the blizzards act simultaneously
you cannot share a position with a blizzard

Part 1
What is the fewest number of minutes required to avoid the blizzards and reach the goal?

test_input: 18 minutes

"Thanks Reddit!" moments:
- I actually should BFS this? Huh. Again? This is like the third day.
- Oooooh, I can treat "position at a given minute" as a unique value that only ever needs to be explored once!
-- ^^ this is the tip that got me across the goal posts :D
